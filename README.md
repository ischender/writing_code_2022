## Hacker culture

_What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show "Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done."_  - Richard Stallman

EG: KISS (keep it simple, stupid), YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It, _Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them_ )

## Humor for coders and hackers

Coders and the like love humor, and making fun of the many frustrations and absurdities involved.

I think it could be possible to create a complete curriculum starting from humor, and digging into what we don't understand. "It is not funny if you have to explain it... but why do they find it funny?"

Start from:

[XKCD](https://xkcd.com/)

[Dilbert](https://dilbert.com/) (hard to understand how much it actually reflects corporate life)
